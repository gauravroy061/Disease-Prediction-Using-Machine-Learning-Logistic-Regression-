# Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Logistic-Regression-
 Predicts disease risk using logistic regression on health data. Includes preprocessing, EDA, training, evaluation, and saves the model as a .pkl file for further use in deployment or analysis.
# 🩺 Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

A simple machine learning project that predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on medical input features using logistic regression.
